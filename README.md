# _Introduction_ #
In this repository, I will show a simple weather checking application based on OpenWeather API. There are 2 functions in this app. The first one is to input a city name and then get the local weather information like wind speed, temperature(Celsius), and the weather description. The second function is to get the local region weather by simply clicking the button. The information will be the same type like the first function.
